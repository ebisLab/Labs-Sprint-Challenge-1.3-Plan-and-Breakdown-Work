# Labs-Sprint-Challenge-1.3-Plan-and-Breakdown-Work

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques that you have been applying to your labs project. This week you have been working as a team to first discover the tasks that need to be broken down into smaller units of work. Also, this week you should have been down in the trenches designing, coding or at the very least setting up the architecture for your labs product and data science problem and we want to hear from you about how things are going.

In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate understanding over what you have been working on by responding to 2 prompts and working alone on some User Stories.

**For the User Stories Quiz** you will need to make a new Trello board and link to it in your Journal Entry document.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Journal Entry.**

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Journal Entry. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your TL if you need direction. Your work reflects your proficiency in user interface and your command of the concepts and techniques in team planning and product vision.

We have allocated time on your schedule to ensure that you get this done at the end of each sprint.

- For Full Time Students: Please submit your work on this journal entry before 12pm PST every Friday.
